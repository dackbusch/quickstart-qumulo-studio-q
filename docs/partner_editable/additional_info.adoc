[start=2]
. Enter your Active Directory base account name and the default password. The user name for this login is not appended with a number. Note that this is not an Active Directory login, but a user that has been created with the same Active Directory default credentials and given read-only privileges to view all settings and activity on the cluster. 

[#test15]

[start=5]
. In the same window, choose any one of the four nodes. The drive details should show all drives as healthy. The drives are the EBS volumes connected to the specific node (EC2 instance) that you selected.

[#test18]
.Qumulo cluster node 1 details

[start=6]
. Choose *Cluster > Network Configuration*. The *Search Domains* shows your fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Each of the four nodes shows a persistent IP address (EC2 primary IP address) and three floating IP addresses (EC2 secondary IP addresses) for IP failover.

[#test19]
.Qumulo network configuration
image::../images/qumulo_network.png[Architecture]

[start=7]
. Choose *Cluster > Active Directory*. At the top of the window, you can confirm that the cluster with the name you gave it has joined the FQDN of your domain.

[#test20]
.Qumulo Active Directory
image::../images/qumulo_ad.png[Architecture]

[start=8]
. Choose *Cluster > SMB Shares*. Note how the *adobe-projects* share has been created. Use this share for all video content and subsequent editing in Adobe Premiere Pro.

[#test21]
.Qumulo SMB shares
image::../images/qumulo_smb.png[Architecture]

[start=9]
. Now, all of the {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure is set up and confirmed to be properly configured. You can move content on to the Qumulo cluster using the *S3 Browser* link on the desktop or any other preferred S3 utility and simply drop the content in the Q drive. All workstations and users now have access to the Q drive. Also, if you create multiple workstations, you can log in to those workstations using the credentials created in this first Teradici session. Any user can log in to any workstation because they are authenticated with Active Directory. 20 users are created by default (for example, studioqUser1, studioqUser2,...studioqUser20). At first login, users must change their password.

== Add another workstation 

The initial deployment deploys 1-10 workstations. If you want to add another workstation, follow these steps:

[start=1]
. Launch the following template:

http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy additional {partner-product-short-name} workstation^] (https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-qumulo-studio-q/blob/main/templates/qs-studioq-add-workstation.cft.yaml[View template^])

[start=2]
. From the original, top-level stack, copy the *WorkstationStackName* key value.

.Stack outputs
image::../images/stackname.png[Architecture]

[start=3]
. Paste the stack name in to the *Add Workstation* template, fill in the fields, and launch the template.

.Add Workstation template input
image::../images/add_workstation.png[Architecture]

[start=4]
. When the stack completes, go to the top level for the new stack and choose *Outputs* to see the public IP address for the new workstation. The new workstation has the same configuration as the original workstations that were created.

.Add Workstation template outputs
image::../images/add_workstation_outputs.png[Architecture]

== Upgrade the Qumulo cluster

Qumulo releases software every two weeks in an agile development fashion. The upgrade process takes only a few minutes and should not impact service.  

[start=1]
. Copy the temporary administrator password from the original stack's top-level outputs.

.Add Workstation template outputs
image::../images/qumulo_temp_pwd.png[Architecture]

[start=2]
. Log in to the Qumulo cluster as *admin* using the copied password.

.Admin Login
image::../images/qumulo_admin_login.png[Architecture]

[start=3]
. In Qumulo-UI, choose *Support > Software Upgrade* and then *Qumulo Care*. For more information about Qumulo upgrades, see https://care.qumulo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007247168-Qumulo-Core-Upgrades-via-UI[Qumulo Core Upgrades via UI^]

.Get the latest upgrade
image::../images/qumulo_get_upgrade.png[Architecture]

[start=4]
. Copy the downloaded .qimg file to any SMB share on the cluster. This example uses the adobe-projects share.

.Qumulo upgrade file copied to adobe-projects
image::../images/upgrade_file.png[Architecture]

[start=5]
. Back in Qumulo-UI, choose *Support > Software Upgrade* and enter the path to the file. Then choose *Upgrade* and confirm to continue. The upgrade takes a few minutes.

.Qumulo upgrade file specified
image::../images/qumulo_upgrade_path.png[Architecture]

[start=6]
. When the upgrade is completed, log back in to the Qumulo cluster and confirm that the new version is installed.

.Qumulo upgraded
image::../images/qumulo_upgraded.png[Architecture]

== Upgrading the sidecar Lambda functions
The final step in the upgrade is to update the Python code in the sidecar Lambda functions. This insures that CloudWatch metrics and EBS volume monitoring are in sync with the latest Qumulo Core software on the cluster.

[start=1]
. In the AWS Console, navigate to CloudFormation and select the original top-level stack for the deployment.  Then select *Update*.

.Update original stack
image::../images/sidecar_update.png[Architecture]

[start=2]
. Keep the default *Use current template*.

.Use current template for the stack update
image::../images/sidecar_usecurrent.png[Architecture]

[start=3]
. The template that you originally filled out is displayed. Scroll to the *Qumulo CloudWatch Metrics & Monitoring Configuration* section and change the *Qumulo Sidecar Template URL* version number in the path to match the version on the Qumulo cluster.

.Use current template for the stack update
image::../images/sidecar_update_version.png[Architecture]

[start=4]
. The top-level stack displays *UPDATE_COMPLETE* in the *Stacks* and *Events* lists.
